<h2><b>Overview <br></b></h2>

The proposed solution is an adaptive personal workout coach with game-like interface that dynamically generates and modifies workout plans based on a user’s progress and recent activity. Unlike static fitness apps, this system creates a feedback loop where users log their workout intensity, completion, and perceived difficulty. Using this data, the app automatically adjusts upcoming routines—either by increasing intensity, reducing rest times, or suggesting alternate exercises—to ensure continuous progress while preventing fatigue or injury. The goal is to provide a personalized, intelligent fitness assistant that evolves with the user’s journey.
